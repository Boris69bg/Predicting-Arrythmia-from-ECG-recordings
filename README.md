# Predicting-Arrythmia-from-ECG-recordings
This project is done on the 2018 GDSO workshop: https://gdso.berkeley.edu/projects.html.

Abstract:
Predictive maintenance has become a billion dollar industry in recent years. It predicts when equipment failure might occur, and allows maintenance to be planned before the failure. In this project, we apply predictive maintenance to arrhythmia forecasting. Specifically, we build a machine-learning model for time series forecasting, and utilize it to predict arrhythmia beats from patientsâ€™ ECG signals. Our training and testing data comes from the MIT-BIH ECG database. With our model, we are able to predict with ~ 80% accuracy whether a patient will have an arrhythmia attack before it actually happens.
